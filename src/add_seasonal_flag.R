#' @title Add flags related to calculated parameter seasonal ranges.
#' @description A function that checks 2 different and separate conditions related to the
#' calculated parameter seasonal ranges. The 'outside of seasonal range' flag is
#' added if the `mean` value is outside the seasonal 1st - 99th percentile. The
#' 'slope violation' flag is added if the `slope_ahead` or `slope_behind` value
#' is greater than or equal to the `t_slope_behind_99` value, or if the
#' `slope_ahead` or `slope_behind` value is less than or equal to the
#' `t_slope_behind_01` value. The `t_slope_behind_99` and `t_slope_behind_01`
#' values are specific to each site-parameter.
#' @param df A data frame with a `flag` column.
#' @threshold_table A dataframe containing seasonal threshold values, make using `make_threshold_table()`.
#' @return A data frame with a `flag` column that has been updated with the
#' relevant calculated seasonal range flags.
#' @seealso [make_threshold_table()]

    # ... flag obs that are outside the seasonal 1st - 99th percentile range:

    # flag obs whose slope is outside the 1st - 99th percentile range:
